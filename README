Project description: A Playable Game

Game Name : Ghost Blaster!

The Specs that I implemented are: All

AI implemented : when player comes near the enemy, enemy skeletons start shooting and moving towards player.
Conclusion : Kill 8 enemies to win the game.
             Ghostrider dies when health is depleted completed.

The Specs that I was unable to implement are: None

Extras: 1)Move Ghost Rider by pressing a and d
		2)Painter's algorithm implemented on the falling flames
		3)Parallax scrolling.
		3)Building sprite out of raw sprite sheet.

Important Note :
Getting valgrind error 1306 in 1 context. After checking it throughly I came to the conclusion that
it maybe due to the sprite sheet I am using since I checked it in different program without errors.

Directions:
1. to change direction of Ghost Rider press a and d keys.

2. to shoot the flaming tree press space.

3. toggle music by pressing m.

Story:
Ghost rider moves along the burning city taking revenge from the enemies that come along. He uses his chain whip to kill enemies. The game may end after a time frame or when he reaches the end of the world. Scores are maintained from the number of enemies killed.
